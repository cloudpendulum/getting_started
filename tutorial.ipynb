    "# Cloud Pendulum Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple example showing how to use the Cloud Pendulum system. This is a system that allows users to remotely run experiments on physical pendulum hardware. The clients requests a \"cell\" to run their experiment on, and the server gives access to these cells whenever one is available. There are many types of experiments you can run on this system (e.g. simple pendulum, double pendulum, acrobot, pendubot etc.), each requiring a specific type of hardware in the cell. In this tutorial we will be using the `DoubleIntegrator` experiment type, which runs on cells that contain a single motor, like the one in the following picture:"

    "The first step is to create an account on the cloud pendulum JupyterHub: https://cloudpendulum.m2.chalmers.se:1443/hub/signup. Once you sign up, contact one of the administrators to authorize your account. Once we authorize, you will be able to login into the system and write your own code for example, related to modeling, simulation, learning and control. During the authorization, you will also be provided with a user token with which you can do experiments on the real hardware. "
