    "Here is a simple example showing how to use the Cloud Pendulum system. This is a system that allows users to remotely run experiments on a single motor Double Integrator hardware. The clients requests a \"cell\" to run their experiment on, and the server gives access to these cells whenever one is available. There are many types of experiments you can run on this system (e.g. simple pendulum, double pendulum, acrobot, pendubot etc.), each requiring a specific type of hardware in the cell. In this tutorial we will be using the `DoubleIntegrator` experiment type, which runs on cells that contain a single motor, like the one in the following picture:"

    "Now that we have reserved a cell from the server and read the data, let's do what we are here for: Let's control the motor! The controller that the API provides us is an impendance controller. The following excerpt from the documentation of the hardware describes its functionality very well:\n",
    "\n",
    "From [MAB documentation](https://mabrobotics.github.io/MD80-x-CANdle-Documentation/MD/motion.html#impedance-pd):\n",
    "\n",
    "Impedance Control mode is a popular choice for mobile or legged robots, as well as for any compliant mechanism. The main idea behind it is to mimic the behavior of a torsional spring with variable stiffness and damping. The parameters of the controller are:\n",
    "- Position Target\n",
    "- Velocity Target\n",
    "- kP (position gain)\n",
    "- kD (velocity gain)\n",
    "- Torque Feed Forward (Torque FF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque output is proportional to the position error and velocity error and additionally supplemented with a torque command from the user. Here are some of the most common applications for this control mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spring-damper mechanism** - when velocity target is set to 0, impedance controllers kP gain acts as the virtual spring stiffness and kD as its damping coefficient. Example use case: a variable suspension for a wheeled robot, where suspension stiffness can be regulated by kP, damping by kD, and height (clearance) by changing the target position;\n",
    "- **High-frequency torque controller**, where its targets and gains can act as stabilizing agents to the torque command. Example use case: In legged robots, force control can be achieved by advanced control algorithms, which usually operate at rates below 100 Hz. It is usually enough to stabilize the robot but too slow to avoid vibrations. Knowing desired robot’s joint positions, velocities, and torques, drives can be set to produce the proper torque and hold the position/velocity with small gains. This would compensate for any high-frequency oscillations (vibrations) that may occur, as the impedance controller works at 40kHz (much faster than <100 Hz).\n",
    "- **Raw torque controller** - when kP and kD are set to zero, the torque_ff command is equal to the output controller torque.\n",
    "- **Idle** - when kP and kD are set to zero, and the torque_ff command is equal to zero, the motor shaft will be free to rotate. When the drive is disabled it connects all the windings together for safety. This mode can be useful for enabling free rotation of the shaft, but the rotational energy should not be too high as the voltages induced in the motor windings could break the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impedance controller is relatively simple and works according to the schematic below:\n",

    "# Realtime control in Linux/Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier, usual operating systems such as Linux or Windows have problems with hard real-time deadlines. This is due to the complexity of the system: To achieve a good performance, features like virtual memory, preemptive multitasking, and complex schedulers have been introduced. They maximize the utilization of the compute resources, but introduce unpredictable latencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen at the start of the tutorial, this can cause our fixed sampling time to vary and the actual sampling time to be a bit longer than desired. The CloudPendulum only provides the hardware and a server to run your code on - what code you run is up to you, so the question how you deal with the system constraints is also up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to give some best practices and to quantify the performance, we made some experiments with the following pseudo code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while t < t_overall:\n",
    "    start_loop = time.time()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do control stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "    time_that_passed = time.time() - start_loop\n",
    "    time.sleep( dt - time_that_passed )\n",
    "```\n",
    "The resulting benchmark of the sampling times, with $dt=0.01s$ looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"media/benchmark_sleep.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "Additionally the controller missed the last 3 ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the difference is usually not too large. As pragmatic approch can therefore be to accept the delays and use a clean-up of the data before plotting. The corresponding code for clean-up is given at the end of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach would be to following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "while t < t_overall:\n",
    "    start_loop = time.time()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do control stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "    while time.time() - start_loop < dt:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is called _busy waiting_, because the process runs all times and checks at each clock cycle if the time has passed. Let us also benchmark this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"media/benchmark_sleep_busy.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "Additionally, the controller missed the last 17 ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is interesting: For the vast majority of steps, the time step was followed very well. But for some steps, the sampling time was exceeded by a lot!\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why this happens, we need to take a look at the internal working principles of our operating system: A CPU core can only execute one process at a time (leaving multi-core CPUs out of consideration for now). The scheduler decides which process gets the priority and is executed on the CPU core at each time. This can be for example this Python program, some background process, or any other program running on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With busy waiting, the Python process checks at each clock cycle if the sampling time has passed. If only the Python process is executed, this leads to be best preformance that we can see in the majority of steps. However, the Python process keeps the CPU busy at all time and thus blocks other processes. At some point, the scheduler will therefore prioritize another process higher and \"pause\" the Python process. This is what happens when we see the large delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the first approach instead, the `sleep()` function, something different happens: In this case, the Python process actively gives back the control of the CPU and notifies the scheduler when it would like to be continued to run. This prevents the large delays, because the scheduler \"knows\" when to run which process. However, it only guarantees to sleep _at least_ for the desired amount of time, and in practice is shows to usually be a bit longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wait_for_control_loop_end` function, that was used above and is implemented a bit more failsafe below, combines these two insights: First, a `sleep` is triggered that allows the scheduler to run other processes, but that is not as precise. Afterwards, this is passed on to busy waiting, that is very precise and will now not be interrupted by the scheduler any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting time accuracy is shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"media/benchmark_sleep_busy_mixed.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "This time, the controller did not miss a tick.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there still are limitations: The function is only a heuristic and gives no guarantees. For a smaller sampling time of $dt = 0.002s$ (five times smaller), also the heuristic reaches its limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"media/benchmark_mixed_0_002.png\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "The missed ticks were in this run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | #Missed ticks |\n",
    "| ------ | ------------- |\n",
    "| sleep  | 81 |\n",
    "| busy waiting | 28 |\n",
    "| mixed | 15| \n",
    "\n",
    "As a closing remark, of course some other methods would be possible. One option would be to use a real-time kernel such as the Ubuntu Realtime Kernel. If the code was implemented in C++ instead of Python, there also would be more options such as using the [nanosleep](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/nanosleep.2.html) function. Both options would however require serious work on the server side of the CloudPendulum and have thus not been implemented yet."
